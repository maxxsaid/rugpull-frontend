# RugPull

## Proposal

A website where users get to anonymously write confessions. I want this website to be a fun site where everyone gets to see anonymous secrets of others. I got this idea from a bar i went to recently, where they had a notebook of all drunk stories written by random people. Basically a bathroom wall of a bar. Everyone has secrets, why not have a website to share them anonymously. It could either be a very fun website, or a disaster. Only one way to find out. At first I will have the basic CRUD working but later on theres a possibility of adding a user auth, like, retween options.
